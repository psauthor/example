The course description is:

> JavaScript has come a long way from script tags on web pages with a singular purpose. As JavaScript projects increase in size, the need to architect these projects has become more and more important. In this course, Modules in JavaScript, you’ll learn how to consume and produce modules in your JavaScript projects. First, you’ll explore how to consume modules. Next, you’ll discover how to write your own modular JavaScript. Finally, you’ll learn how to use modules in the browser as well as in server-side JavaScript (e.g. Node.js and Deno). When you’re finished with this course, you’ll have the skills and knowledge of modular JavaScript needed to build projects, both server-side and client-side.

If you have any problems, please add a issue to the repository. I'll do my best to address issues quickly.
